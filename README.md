"Blogicum" is a blogging platform. You can run your own blog, read blogs of other authors and comment on their posts. You can attach a photo to each post.
User registration and authorization has been implemented, and the ability to send emails with a registration code has been enabled.
There are three categories of users: regular, administrator and superuser.
The admin area also exists.
The administrator can edit posts and comments of other users, or remove them from publication. Posts can be sorted by authorship, by category, and by location. Pagination is implemented on the site.
